## CryptoPay Contest

I participated in a web development [competition](https://t.me/CryptoBotRU/225) and was rewarded for securing second place. The challenge was to create a layout for a one-page website in complete accordance with a provided [design](https://www.figma.com/file/eygHPZ8VPs89u74Wop0Wzd/Vedenskaia-%2F-CryptoPay?type=design&node-id=955%3A3928&mode=design&t=yqjXjWzbEJX0Gpeb-1). The website was required to be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the option to utilize frameworks; therefore, I decided to use Next.js for its efficient server-side rendering capabilities.
